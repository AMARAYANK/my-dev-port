{{< aboutIntro text="Hi there!">}}

  *Hello! My name is Amarjeet, shortly **Amar**. I'm an economics grad. I love computers and*
  *really enjoy creating things that live on internet. My interest in web*
  *development started back during college in 2018 when I wanted to build a website called*
  *fundmyfest.com for my roommate to find sponsors for our college fest - turns*
 *out hacking together few pages taught me a lot about HTML and CSS! This sparked my curiosity for programming.*

 *During my college days, I had a startup of cloud kitchen which was entirely operated by myself from end to end. I believe this is one of the event which has shaped my identity.* 
 *The major learnings from I had with my first startup is about the entrepreneurial culture which*
 *is characterized by bluntness. One must think analytically and have an open culture towards* *criticism. I believe it is better to lay out the actual facts and not be afraid to share bad news.*
 *This has also made me diligent, meticulous and good at planning. Alongwith, all of this one of the most important skilksets which I developed is strong interpersonal skills and learnt the diplomatic approach of managerial communication.*

 *Fast-forward to today, besides front-end development, my interests extend to back-end development and learning golang and elixir. I’m particularly interested in distributed systems, how they work, their reliability and scalability.*

 *Fast-forward to today, besides front-end development, my interests extend to back-end development and learning golang and elixir. I’m particularly interested in distributed systems, how they work, their reliability and scalability.*
